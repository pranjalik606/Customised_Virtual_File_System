1. This project provides all the comprehensive functionalities that mirrors the Linux file system.
2. It provides necessary commands, System calls implimentations of file system through customised shell.
3. In this project we impliment all necessary data structures of file system like Incore Inode Table, File Table, UAREA, User File Descriptor table.
4. Using this project we can use every system level functionality of Linux operating system on any other operating system platfrom.
5. We provide our own customides shell to interact with the customides database management system. 

Key Features:
1) Custom Shell with Linux Commands: The project includes a customized shell that supports necessary Linux file system commands, making it intuitive for users familiar with Linux.
2) System Call Implementations: Implementing crucial system calls ensures that the project provides functionality similar to the native Linux environment.

File System Data Structures:
1) Icore Inode Table: Efficiently manages inodes currently in memory.
2) File Table: Keeps track of open files and their attributes.
3) UAREA (User Area): Manages user-specific data necessary for file operations.
4) UFDT (User File Descriptor Table): Handles file descriptors allocated to user processes.
      
Cross-Platform Compatibility: This project enables Linux-like system-level functionalities on other operating systems, making it a versatile tool for developers and users alike.
